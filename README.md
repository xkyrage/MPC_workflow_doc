## ❓ FAQ

Q: Can I master only on the MPC without external plugins?
- A: Yes! The MPC includes EQs, compressors, and a limiter that are enough for solid masters. External plugins just provide more flexibility.

Q: What’s the best export format?
- A: For mastering, always export at 24-bit WAV. For release, bounce to 16-bit WAV (44.1kHz) or 320kbps MP3.
