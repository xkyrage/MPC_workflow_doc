# 🎚️ Mixing & Mastering Cheat Sheet (Akai MPC One+)

A step-by-step guide with recommended dB levels, EQ, compression, effects, and mastering workflow.  

---

## 1. Preparation
- Import/record all tracks.  
- Label & organize (Kick, Snare, Hats, 808, Bass, Melody, Pads, Vocals, etc.).  
- **Gain staging**: keep tracks at **-12 dB to -6 dB peak**.  
- Leave **headroom**: master bus should not clip, mix should peak around **-6 dB** before mastering.  

---

## 2. Mixing Phase

### A. Balance (Faders & Pan)
- Kick: **-6 dB**, center  
- Snare: **-6 to -8 dB**, center  
- Hi-Hats/Percs: **-12 to -15 dB**, panned L/R  
- 808/Bass: **-6 to -8 dB**, mono  
- Melody/Synths: **-12 dB**, stereo  
- Pads/Atmos: **-14 dB**, wide  
- Vocals: **-6 to -8 dB**, center  

👉 Start with drums + bass, then add melody & pads.

### B. EQ (Cleanup & Enhancement)

#### Drums
- **Kick**: HPF 30 Hz, boost 60–80 Hz thump, cut 200–300 Hz mud, boost 2–4 kHz click  
- **Snare**: HPF 100 Hz, boost 150–200 Hz body, cut 400–600 Hz box, boost 5–8 kHz snap  
- **Hi-Hats**: HPF 300 Hz, boost 8–12 kHz brightness, cut 2–3 kHz if harsh  
- **Rides/Crash**: HPF 300 Hz, boost 10–12 kHz shimmer  
- **808**: LPF 8–10 kHz, boost 40–80 Hz, cut 200–300 Hz mud  

#### Instruments
- **Synth/Keys**: HPF 150 Hz, boost 2–5 kHz presence, cut 300 Hz mud  
- **Pads/Atmos**: HPF 200 Hz, boost 8–12 kHz air  
- **Bass (non-808)**: HPF 30 Hz, boost 60–100 Hz low, cut 200–400 Hz mud, boost 700 Hz for clarity  

---

### C. Compression (Control & Punch)
- **Kick/Snare**: 4:1 ratio, Attack 10–30 ms, Release 50–100 ms, GR 3–5 dB  
- **808/Bass**: 3:1 ratio, Attack 30 ms, Release medium, GR 3–6 dB  
- **Melody/Synths**: 2:1 ratio, fast attack, medium release, GR 2–3 dB  
- **Master Bus (Glue)**: 2:1 ratio, Attack 30 ms, Release slow/auto, GR 2–3 dB  

---

### D. Effects & Space
- **Reverb**:  
  - Small room for drums  
  - Plate/hall for melody/pads/vocals  
- **Delay**:  
  - Sync to tempo for melodies/vocals  
- **Stereo Imaging**:  
  - Kick, snare, bass, 808 = mono  
  - Hats/percs = ±20–40 pan  
  - Pads/synths = wide stereo

## 3. Mastering Phase

### A. Final EQ
- Slight cut at 40 Hz if boomy  
- Slight boost at 10 kHz for air  

### B. Glue Compression (Multiband Concept)
- **Low (20–120 Hz)**: tighten bass/kick (GR 2–4 dB)  
- **Mid (200 Hz–2 kHz)**: smooth muddiness/harshness (GR 2–3 dB)  
- **High (5–15 kHz)**: tame hat/cymbal spikes (GR 1–2 dB)  

### C. Limiter / Maximizer
- Ceiling: **-0.3 dB**  
- Loudness: **-8 to -9 LUFS** (streaming safe, loud but not crushed)  

### D. Stereo Enhancer (Optional)
- Add subtle width (avoid overdoing).

## 4. Final Checks
- Compare with reference tracks.  
- Listen on different systems (monitors, headphones, car, phone).  
- Export in **24-bit WAV**, convert to MP3 if needed.

## ✅ Workflow Order
1. Preparation → Gain staging, organization  
2. Balance → Faders & panning  
3. EQ → Cleanup & enhancement  
4. Compression → Dynamics control & punch  
5. Effects → Reverb, delay, imaging  
6. Mastering → EQ, glue compression, limiter, stereo  
7. Final Checks → Reference & export
