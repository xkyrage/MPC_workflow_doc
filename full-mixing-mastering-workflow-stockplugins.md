# 🎚️ Full Mixing & Mastering Workflow (MPC One+ Stock FX)

> ✅ All plugins listed are included in the MPC One+ (AIR FX suite + stock processors).  
> No external VSTs required.

---

## 0. Preparation
- Trim samples, clean up silence.  
- Name tracks clearly (Kick, Snare, Hats, 808, Bass, Lead, Pads, Vocals).  
- Create **Submixes**:
  - Drums Bus
  - Perc Bus
  - Bass Bus
  - Melody Bus
  - Vocal Bus  

---

## 1. Track Gain (Input Leveling)
- Tool: **Track Mixer Gain/Fader**  
- Set peaks to **-12 to -6 dB** per track.  
- Leave **-6 dB headroom** on the master bus.

---

## 2. Static Balance (Faders & Panning)
- Tool: **Mixer faders + pan knobs**  
- Balance rough levels before EQ/Comp.  
- Pan hats/percussion slightly, keep kick/bass/808/vocals centered.

---

## 3. Corrective EQ (Cleanup)
- Tool: **AIR Parametric EQ / AIR Kill EQ**  
- Steps:
  - HPF non-bass tracks below **80–150 Hz**.  
  - Cut **200–400 Hz** if muddy.  
  - Remove harshness in **2–4 kHz** if needed.  
- Example: Vocals → HPF at 100 Hz, cut boxy 300 Hz, tame sibilance at 5–7 kHz.

---

## 4. Compression (Dynamics Control)
- Tools:  
  - **AIR Compressor** → general dynamics.  
  - **AIR Channel Strip** → combined EQ + Comp.  
  - **AIR Tube Compressor** → warm compression.  
- Settings:
  - Kick/Snare → Ratio **4:1**, Attack **10–30 ms**, GR **3–5 dB**.  
  - Bass/808 → Ratio **3:1**, GR **3–6 dB**.  
  - Vocals → Ratio **3:1**, fast attack, GR **2–5 dB**.  

---

## 5. Tonal EQ (Shaping / Boosts)
- Tools:  
  - **AIR Parametric EQ** → precise tone shaping.  
  - **AIR Enhancer** → brightness & clarity.  
- Moves:
  - Boost **60–80 Hz** (kick thump).  
  - Boost **2–5 kHz** (vocal presence, snare crack).  
  - Boost **10–12 kHz** (air, shimmer on hats/pads).  

---

## 6. Parallel Processing / Saturation
- Tools:  
  - **AIR Distortion / AIR Saturator** → warmth & grit.  
  - **AIR Channel Strip (parallel comp)** → thick drums/vocals.  
- Trick: Duplicate track, apply heavy comp/sat, blend low in mix.

---

## 7. Reverb & Delay (Space & Depth)
- Tools:  
  - **AIR Reverb** → space.  
  - **AIR Delay** → echo.  
  - **AIR Multi-Delay** → creative effects.  
- Tips:
  - Drums → short room reverb.  
  - Vocals → plate/hall reverb, pre-delay 20–40 ms.  
  - Use **aux sends**, not inserts, for better control.  
  - HPF reverb send below 300 Hz to avoid mud.  

---

## 8. Bus & Master Processing (Glue)
- Tools:  
  - **AIR Bus Compressor** → glue drum bus / master.  
  - **AIR Maximizer** → final loudness.  
  - **AIR Stereo Width** → widen pads/synths (use sparingly).  
- Settings:
  - Bus compression → Ratio **2:1**, GR **2–3 dB**.  
  - Master compression → light (1–2 dB GR).  
  - Limiter (AIR Maximizer) → Ceiling **-0.8 dB**, final LUFS ~ **-8 to -9**.  

---

## 9. Automation
- Tools: **Q-Link Knobs + Automation Lane**.  
- Automate:
  - Volume rides (vocals, build-ups).  
  - Reverb sends (more space in choruses).  
  - Filter sweeps (AIR Filter Gate / AIR Filter).  

---

## 10. Final Checks & Export
- Tools: **AIR Stereo Width**, **AIR Maximizer** (final polish).  
- Checklist:
  - Mono check: disable Stereo Width → mix still solid?  
  - Reference: compare with commercial track on MPC.  
  - Export: **24-bit WAV**, Master peak below 0 dBFS.  
  - Headroom: leave **-6 dB** pre-master if exporting for external mastering.
