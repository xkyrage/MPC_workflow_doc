# 🎚️ Mixing & Mastering Enhancement Tips (MPC One+)

## 1. Gain Staging
- Keep individual track peaks around **-6 dB to -10 dB**.  
- Avoid clipping (red meters).  
- Use **track gain**, not EQ boost, for balance.

### Track Gain 
- volume control for the raw audio signal before effects or EQ.
- It sets the input level of the track going into your mix bus.
- On the MPC One+, it’s basically the track level knob/fader in the mixer.

### Why Track Gain Matters
- Prevents clipping → keeps signals from distorting before effects.
- Controls headroom → gives space for EQ, compression, and mastering.
- Balances tracks early → makes mixing easier without relying on plugins.

### How to Use Track Gain properly
- Start your mix by adjusting track gain, not EQ.
- Keep each track peaking around -12 dB to -6 dB.
- Balance all tracks with gain before adding effects.
- Use EQ to shape tone, not to fix volume issues.

### Track Gain Analogy
Think of Track Gain as the water pressure going into a pipe.
- If it’s too high → the pipe bursts (clipping).
- If it’s too low → nothing flows (too quiet).
- Once the pressure is right → you can use EQ/FX (like filters and valves) to shape the flow.

👉 In short: Track Gain = the foundation of a clean, balanced mix.

## 2. EQ & Frequency Management
- **Cut before boosting** → clears space.  
- **High-Pass Filter (HPF)** non-bass instruments below **80–150 Hz**.  
- Watch **200–400 Hz “mud zone”** → cut if mix is boxy.  
- Add **2–5 kHz** for clarity/presence (vocals, instruments).  
- Add **10–12 kHz** gently for brightness/air.

---

## 3. Compression & Glue
- Use **bus compression** on drums to “glue” them.  
- Ratio **2:1 – 4:1**, with **3–5 dB gain reduction**.  
- Try **parallel compression** for drums/vocals.  
- Don’t over-compress → keep dynamics alive.

## 4. Stereo Imaging
- Keep **kick, snare, bass, 808** centered/mono.  
- Pan hats, rides, percussion slightly left/right.  
- Use stereo widening **sparingly** (pads, synths, atmos).  
- Check mono compatibility before final bounce.

---

## 5. Reverb & Depth
- **Short room reverb** → drums.  
- **Plate/Hall reverb** → vocals.  
- Add **pre-delay (20–40 ms)** to separate vocals from reverb.  
- Keep reverb subtle to avoid muddy mix.

## 6. Mastering on MPC One+
- Leave **-6 dB headroom** on the mix.  
- Apply gentle EQ shaping:  
  - Low shelf cut (20–40 Hz) → remove rumble.  
  - Tiny high shelf boost (10–12 kHz) → sparkle.  
- Use **multiband compression** for balance.  
- **Limiter**:  
  - Ceiling **-0.8 dB**  
  - Target **-9 to -6 LUFS** (streaming).  
- Compare with **reference tracks** in your genre.

## 7. Workflow Tips (MPC)
- Use **Track Mute & Solo** to check elements.  
- **Submixes**: Route drums to one bus.  
- **Save versions** as checkpoints.  
- **Bounce stems** if finishing in a DAW.

---

## 8. Mindset
- **Less is more** → don’t process every track.  
- **Use ears, not eyes** → trust your hearing.  
- **Take breaks** → avoid ear fatigue.  
- **Test on multiple systems** (headphones, car, speakers).

🔥 **Extra Tip:** MPC One+ has limited CPU → freeze/bounce heavy effects, use submixes, and keep things efficient.
